## MV Redevelopment Fund Disappears With $3MM


The fund was started in 2019 by Monick Halm (known for her [Real Estate Investor Goddess](https://www.realestateinvestorgoddesses.com/) network) and Vicky Schettini as the principals, Amanda Han ([CPA at Keystone](https://www.keystonecpa.com/About-Us)), Peter Halm (also from [Real Estate Investor Goddess](https://www.realestateinvestorgoddesses.com/)) as the advisors. They raising about $3MM to flip houses in Jackson, Mississippi. The secured term certificates is secured by the assets in the fund, but the managers have taken liens against the properties and might've misappropriated the funds entirely. 

The fund has not paid any interest since Jan 1, 2020 citing COVID, and the principle is due this year (most investments in the fund carry a 3 year term on 18%/year interest).

The fund's email is no longer active as of Jan 30, 2022. I personally put in a substantial amount. I started this group with two goals:

- To find other victims of this fund so we can work together to recover the funds. Please email me at mvcapitalrecovery@gmail.com

- To alert the community of this outrageous syndicators
