## MV Redevelopment Fund Alert


The fund was started in 2019 by Monick Halm (known for her [Real Estate Investor Goddess](https://www.realestateinvestorgoddesses.com/) network) and Vicky Schettini as the principals, Amanda Han ([CPA at Keystone](https://www.keystonecpa.com/About-Us)), Peter Halm (also from [Real Estate Investor Goddess](https://www.realestateinvestorgoddesses.com/)) as the advisors. They raising about $3MM to flip houses in Jackson, Mississippi. The fund has stopped paying interest since Jan 1, 2020 to me. I personally put in a substantial amount. I started this page with two goals:

- To find other investors of this fund so we can work together to recover the funds. We can pool resources to recover the fund. Please kindly email me at **mvcapitalrecovery@gmail.com**

- To alert the community of the behaviors of these syndicators


Stay Safe,
